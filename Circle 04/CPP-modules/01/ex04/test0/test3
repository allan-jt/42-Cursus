Bjarne Stroustrup;[2][3] born 30 December 1950) is a Danish computer scientist, most notable for the invention and development of the C++ programming language.[4] 
He is a visiting professor at Columbia University,[5] and works at Morgan Stanley as a managing director in New York.[6]

Stroustrup was born in Aarhus, Denmark. His family was working class, and he went to the local schools.[7]

He attended Aarhus University 1969â€“1975 and graduated with a master's degree in mathematics and computer science. His interests focused on microprogramming and machine architecture. He learned the fundamentals of object-oriented programming from its inventor, Kristen Nygaard, who frequently visited Aarhus.

In 1979, he received a PhD in computer science from the University of Cambridge,[8] where he was supervised by David Wheeler.[1][9] His thesis concerned communication in distributed computer systems.[10]

In 1979, Stroustrup began his career as a member of technical staff in the Computer Science Research Center of Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey, USA. There, he began his work on C++ and programming techniques. Stroustrup was the head of AT&T Bell Labs' Large-scale Programming Research department, from its creation until late 2002. In 1993, he was made a Bell Labs fellow and in 1996, an AT&T Fellow.

From 2002 to 2014, Stroustrup was the College of Engineering Chair Professor in Computer Science at Texas A&M University.[11][12] From 2011, he was made a University Distinguished Professor.

As of January 2014, Stroustrup is a technical fellow and managing director in the technology division of Morgan Stanley in New York City and a visiting professor in computer science at Columbia University.[13]

Stroustrup is best known for his work on C++. In 1979, he began developing C++ (initially called "C with Classes"). In his own words, he "invented C++, wrote its early definitions, and produced its first implementation [...] chose and formulated the design criteria for C++, designed all its major facilities, and was responsible for the processing of extension proposals in the C++ standards committee." C++ was made generally available in 1985. For non-commercial use, the source code of the compiler and the foundation libraries was the cost of shipping (US$75); this was before Internet access was common. Stroustrup also published a textbook for the language in 1985, The C++ Programming Language.[14]
