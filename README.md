# 42-Cursus

Hello all! Here you'll find all the projects I've done at 42 Abu Dhabi, which is a free coding that's part of the global 42 network. Fellow students can also find my projects on the Intra by searching for my username: **athekkep**

### What is 42?
A free [coding school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(school)) started by Xavier Niel, a French billionaire in the tech industry. The program first started in Paris in 2013 and soon spread to more than 20 countries. The newest one is [42 Abu Dhabi](https://42abudhabi.ae/), where I'm a student.

### 42's educational philosophy
- **Project-based approach:** We learn through projects, where each one introduces a new concept in computer science for us to master.
- **Peer-to-peer learning:** There are no teachers; students must figure out how to do projects on their own or with the help of others.
- **Self-paced:** There are no project deadlines. We work at our own pace, although the program must be completed within 18 months.
- More about 42's curriculum can be found [here](https://42abudhabi.ae/curriculum).

### More info on projects & exams
- Projects are grouped together in--what we colloquially refer to as--'circles' along the lines of difficulty/complexity. To progress to the next circle, you must complete all the projects and the exam in the current circle.
- Initially, projects are done in C but as we progress through the circles, we get introduced to other programming languages.
- Each project has a mandatory and a bonus section. The latter can only be graded if everything in the madatory section is correct. Mandatories get graded out of 100 and bonuses 25.
- Exams are graded out of 100 and a full score is needed to pass; no bonuses. There's one exam in each circle.
