## Thoughts by Creed
1. "I’ve been involved in a number of cults, both as a leader and a follower. You have more fun as a follower. But you make more money as a leader."

2. "The only difference between me and a homeless man is this job. I will do whatever it takes to survive . . . like I did when I was a homeless man."

3. "I've never owned a refrigerator before."

4. "Did one of you tell Stanley that I have asthma. ‘Cause I don’t. If this gets out, they won’t let me scuba. And if I can’t scuba, what am I working toward?"

5. "It's Halloween . . . that is really, really good timing." (he says drenched in blood)

6. "I already won the lottery. I was born in the US of A baby! And as a backup, I have a Swiss passport."

7. "I sprout mung beans on a damp paper towel in my desk drawer. Very nutritious, but they smell like death."

8. "Oh, I steal things all the time. It's just something I do. I stopped caring a long time ago. You should see how many supplies I’ve taken from this place. Honestly, I love stealing things."

9. "I'm 30. Well, in November I'll be 30."

10. "Listen, I got the answer: you declare bankruptcy and all your problems go away."
